INSTALLATION:

The installer will install the following files and directories:

  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.LoginHookWarden.CheckHooks.plist

  /usr/LoginHookWarden/

There's no need to reboot.

Existing Login and Logout hooks will still work after installation, even though the existing LoginHook and LogoutHook settings are overwitten.

The installer will fail if LoginHookWarden is already installed, or if the installer determines that another process is managing LoginHooks.

After installation, you can write to the relevant com.apple.loginwindow key value several times, to create several login and logout hooks - all of which will be serviced.


ADDING A CUSTOM LOGIN HOOK

Adding a custom LoginHook or LogoutHook is done as you would expect, by using the defaults command to write a value to the relevant com.apple.loginwindow key as follows:

  defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook PATH-SCRIPT
  defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook PATH-SCRIPT


LOGS:

Logs are written to the following file:

  /Library/Logs/com.github.execriez.LoginHookWarden.log
