The installer installs the following files and directories:

  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.LoginHookWarden.CheckHooks.plist

  /usr/LoginHookWarden/

After installation, existing Login and Logout hooks will still work.

To add another LoginHook or LogoutHook, use the defaults command to write a value to the relevant plist key - just as you would do normally, i.e:

  defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook PATH-TO-SCRIPT
  defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook PATH-TO-SCRIPT

You can do this as often as you like, to create as many login and logout hooks as you want.

After installation, you can check the log file here:

  /Library/Logs/com.github.execriez.LoginHookWarden.log
